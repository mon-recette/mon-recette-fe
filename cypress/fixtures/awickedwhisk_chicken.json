              "Ravioli Dough To make this Homemade Chicken Ravioli Recipe, start by making your homemade ravioli dough.",
              "On your clean counter top or a large cutting board, add your flour and salt and lightly mix with a fork to combine.  Now, using your hand, made a well in the middle of the flour, almost so it looks like a volcano. Next, add your eggs, olive oil and water to the middle of the volcano and lightly whisk the eggs together a bit, doing your best not to let your eggs escape and break out of the volcano. Now, using your hands, lightly start combining the flour and the egg mixture and once the dough starts to look like … dough ….",
              "start kneeding it together and folding the dough on top of itself over and over again for about 10 minutes.",
              "if the dough feels too dry, add a bit more water.",
              "The dough shouldn't be crumbly but it shoudn't stick to everything either.",
              "Then form your ravioli dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit undisturbed on your kitchen counter for one hour. Chicken Ravioli Filling While your dough is resting, make your Homemade Chicken Ravioli filling by adding one tablespoon olive oil and your ground chicken to a skillet and cook over medium high heat until no longer pink.",
              "While your chicken is cooking, add the garlic, carrot, celery and parsley to a blender or food processor and pulse to chop your ingredients.",
              "Add your chicken and any left over cooking liquid along with the parmesan, egg, ricotta cheese and seasonings.",
              "Pulse until all ingredients are mixed, scraping down the sides occasionally. Homemade Chicken Ravioli Now comes the fun part! On your countertop or a large cutting board (glass cutting boards are the BEST!), unwrap your ravioli dough and tear off a chunk about the size of a tennis ball.",
              "Throw some flour down on your work surface and a little on the top of the dough you are about to roll out and then using a rolling pin, start rolling the dough out and away from you, back and forth and side to side until you have a rectangle type shape about 16 inches long and about 10 inches wide. At this time, grab your ravioli tray and with non-stick cooking spray, lightly coat the top of the tray and the bottom of the press tray.",
              "Gently move your dough to lighly rest on top of your ravioli tray and lightly press down on the dough by placing the press tray on top to create the well.",
              "Gently remove the press tray and using a spoon, fill your ravioli wells with your chicken filling, taking care not to over fill of have your filling extend past the wells.",
              "It takes one of two ravioli to get your method on lock but once you do a few, you will see how easy it is to fill them in.",
              "Then roll out another sheet of dough exactly as you did the first and lay it gently on top of your filled ravioli. Take your rolling pin and lightly roll your pin over the dough to seal the ravioli.",
              "Using your finger or the back of a spoon, carefully remove the excess dough from the edges of the frame and lightly run your finger down all of the cross grooves to make sure all sides of your ravioli are sealed.",
              "Lift your tray and carefully turn upsidedown on a parchement paper lined baking tray.",
              "The chicken ravioli should easily release from the tray and then you can gently tear them apart from each other.",
              "Collect the dough scraps and re-roll to make another batch of raviolis. At this point, decide if you want to freeze them to be served later or if you are cooking them now.",
              "If you are cooking your chicken ravioli now, add the ravioli to a large boiling pot of salted water and cook for 5 - 6 minutes.",
